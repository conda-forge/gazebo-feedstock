# We want to permit to side-by-side installation of gazebo
# and libgz-tools2 to facilitate migration to gz-sim, however
# they both install gz. So, we are building two different variants:
# * One called `origname` that has higher priority and is installed if libgz-tools2 is not installed,
#   that uses gz as the name for the cli helper of gazebo classic. This variant can't be installed if
#   libgz-tools2 is installed. This variant also install an executable called gz11 for forward compatibility.
# * Another variant, called `gzcompatname` that is co-installable with libgz-tools2, but that renames
#   the gz commmand line tool to gz11
GZ_CLI_NAME_VARIANT:
  - "origname"
  - "gzcompatname"
